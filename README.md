# Hugo Encryptor üîè

> Note: This is a fork of https://github.com/Li4n0/hugo_encryptor

**Hugo Encryptor** is a tool to protect your [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) posts. It uses AES-256 to encrypt the contents of your posts, and inserts a snippet of `<script>` code to verify whether the password is correct or not in readers' browser. Without a correct key, nobody can decrypt your private posts.

Note: `Hugo Encryptor` currently works with `HTML` and `XML` outputs only

## Note ‚ö†Ô∏è

- Do remember to keep the source code of your encrypted posts private. Never push your blog directory into a public repository.

- Every time when you generate your site, you should run `hugo_encryptor` again to encrypt the posts which you want to be protected. If you are worried about you will forgot that, it's a good idea to use a shell script to take the place of  `hugo` ,such as below:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    hugo
    hugo_encryptor
    # Then upload your generated output
    ```
