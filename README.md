# Hugo Enc (Encryptor) üîè

> Note: This is a fork of https://github.com/Li4n0/hugo_encryptor

**Hugo Enc** is a tool to protect your [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) posts. It uses AES-256 to encrypt the contents of your posts, and inserts a snippet of `<script>` code to verify whether the password is correct or not in readers' browser. Without a correct key, nobody can decrypt your private posts.

**Hugo Enc** currently works with `HTML`, `XML` and `JSON` outputs.

## Adding custom Text to `hugo_enc` shortcode

You can use the following `params` in your `site config.yml`:

```yml
Params:
    hugoEnc:
        promptText: "Part of this article is encrypted with password:"
        inputPlaceholder: "Please input the password"
        buttonText: "Unlock"
```

## Note ‚ö†Ô∏è

-   Do remember to keep the source code of your encrypted posts private. Never push your blog directory into a public repository.

-   Every time when you generate your site, you should run `hugo_enc` again to encrypt the posts which you want to be protected. If you are worried about you will forget that, it's a good idea to use a shell script to take the place of `hugo`,such as below:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    hugo
    hugo_enc
    # Then upload your generated output
    ```
